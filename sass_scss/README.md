Introduction
This README provides an overview of Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and SCSS (Sassy CSS), including their purpose, features, and usage.

What is Sass?
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It provides several features not available in regular CSS, such as variables, nesting, and mixins, making CSS code more maintainable and scalable.

What is SCSS?
SCSS is a syntax extension of CSS that uses the syntax of Sass with the .scss file extension. It is fully compatible with CSS, meaning that all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. SCSS brings the power of Sass to CSS, allowing developers to use features like variables and nesting while maintaining CSS compatibility.

Features of Sass/SCSS
Variables: Easily define reusable values to be used throughout your stylesheets.
Nesting: Write more organized and readable code by nesting CSS rules within one another.
Mixins: Reuse blocks of styles across your stylesheets by defining mixins.
Inheritance: Utilize the @extend directive to share styles between selectors.
Partials: Break your stylesheets into smaller, more manageable files and import them as needed.
Functions: Write reusable pieces of styles, like color manipulation or math functions.
Control Directives: Employ control directives like @if, @for, and @each for more dynamic stylesheets.
